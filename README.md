# BlindVision

Blind individuals face challenges in navigating their surroundings without a mobility aid, including difficulty detecting obstacles, navigating unfamiliar environments, and increased risk of accidents. This can limit their independence and lead to social isolation. A smart walking stick can help address these challenges by providing enhanced obstacle detection, navigation assistance, and other features to improve safety, independence, and overall quality of life.
